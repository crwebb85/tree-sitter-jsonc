# tree-sitter-jsonc

This is a fork from [original tree-sitter-jsonc](https://gitlab.com/WhyNotHugo/tree-sitter-jsonc).
I'm forking because treesitter.nvim dropped support for parsers backed by gitlab
URLs in [commit](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/commit/d2350758b39dce3593ffa8b058f863ea4cfa5b0e).

The jsonc spec is stable so I don't expect this tree-sitter parser to ever need updates
other than to bump dependency versions.

JSON grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)

Heavily based on [tree-sitter-json](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-json).
